The first is the quantity of total protein; the second is a keyword which identifies the source of the conversion factor used to calculate the total protein from total nitrogen; and the third is the actual conversion factor used. If possible, all three pieces of data should be included with <PROCNT>. However, it is acceptable to include only the keyword or the conversion factor (rather than both) with the total protein value if one or the other is unknown.

Therefore, the protein value would be listed using the <PROCNT> tagname and the STD keyword:\n<PROCNT> 3.2 STD </PROCNT>\n\nThe 3.3 g/100 g of protein in cow's milk which is listed in McCance and Widdowson was calculated from total nitrogen using a 6.38 conversion factor.

Therefore, the protein value would be listed using the <PROCNT> tagname, the FAO keyword, and the <XN> secondary tagname:\n<PROCNT> 3.3 FAO <XN> 6.38 </PROCNT>\n\nAs a hypothetical example, if a value of 0.3 g/100 g of protein in watermelon seeds were calculated from total nitrogen using the conversion factor 5.30, and this value had not been taken from one of the tables identified by the list of keywords, the protein value would be listed using the <PROCNT> tagname in the following manner:\n<PROCNT> 0.3 <XN> 5.30 </PROCNT>\nNote# In these examples, </PROCNT> is an end-tag required in interchange format to indicate the end of the information about protein calculated from total nitrogen.
